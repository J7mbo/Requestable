Requestable
===========

Webservice to easily send HTTP requests.

This service is useful when testing or debugging other webservice.

It supports all HTTP verbs and other HTTP options. It currently uses cURL, but I *might* switch to [Artax][artax] at some point.

To see the thing in action click [here][demo].
